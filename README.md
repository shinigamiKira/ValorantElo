# VALORANT Elo Tracker
Track and view your VALORANT elo with this web application. As of 12/26, the original site has been taken down.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.X and pip on your computer. You can download it on Windows [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab), and most Macbooks should already have Python pre-installed.
2. Clone the code/repo (download the zip, utilize `git clone`, or any other method)
3. In the root directory, run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python3 ./wsgi.py`
5. If no errors occur, visit the site `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser of choice. Only the computer you ran step 4 on will have access to this site.
